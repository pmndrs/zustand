A small, fast and scalable bearbones state-management solution. Has a comfy api based on hooks, isn't
boilerplatey or opinionated, but still just enough to be explicit and flux-like.

Don't disregard it because it's cute. It has quite the claws, lots of time was spent to deal with common pitfalls, like the dreaded [zombie child problem](https://react-redux.js.org/api/hooks#stale-props-and-zombie-children), [react concurrency](https://github.com/bvaughn/rfcs/blob/useMutableSource/text/0000-use-mutable-source.md), and [context loss](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13332) between mixed renderers. It may be the one state-manager in the React space that gets all of these right.

You can try a live demo [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/dazzling-moon-itop4).

```bash
npm install zustand
```

### First create a store

Your store is a hook! You can put anything in it: primitives, objects, functions. The `set` function _merges_ state.

```jsx
import create from 'zustand'

const useStore = create((set) => ({
  bears: 0,
  increasePopulation: () => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + 1 })),
  removeAllBears: () => set({ bears: 0 }),
}))
```

### Then bind your components, and that's it!

Use the hook anywhere, no providers needed. Select your state and the component will re-render on changes.

```jsx
function BearCounter() {
  const bears = useStore((state) => state.bears)
  return <h1>{bears} around here ...</h1>
}

function Controls() {
  const increasePopulation = useStore((state) => state.increasePopulation)
  return <button onClick={increasePopulation}>one up</button>
}
```

#### Why zustand over react-redux?

- Simple and un-opinionated
- Makes hooks the primary means of consuming state
- Doesn't wrap your app in context providers
- [Can inform components transiently (without causing render)](recipes#transient-updates-for-often-occurring-state-changes)
