A small, fast, and scalable bearbones state management solution.
Zustand has a comfy API based on hooks.
It isn't boilerplatey or opinionated,
but has enough convention to be explicit and flux-like.

Don't disregard it because it's cute, it has claws!
Lots of time was spent to deal with common pitfalls,
like the dreaded [zombie child problem],
[React concurrency], and [context loss]
between mixed renderers.
It may be the one state manager in the React space that gets all of these right.

You can try a live demo [here](https://codesandbox.io/s/dazzling-moon-itop4).

## Installation

Zustand is available as a package on NPM for use:

```bash
# NPM
npm install zustand
# Or, use any package manager of your choice.
```

## First create a store

Your store is a hook!
You can put anything in it: primitives, objects, functions.
The `set` function _merges_ state.

```js
import { create } from 'zustand'

const useStore = create((set) => ({
  bears: 0,
  increasePopulation: () => set((state) => ({ bears: state.bears + 1 })),
  removeAllBears: () => set({ bears: 0 }),
  updateBears: (newBears) => set({ bears: newBears }),
}))
```

## Then bind your components, and that's it!

You can use the hook anywhere, without the need of providers.
Select your state and the consuming component
will re-render when that state changes.

```jsx
function BearCounter() {
  const bears = useStore((state) => state.bears)
  return <h1>{bears} bears around here...</h1>
}

function Controls() {
  const increasePopulation = useStore((state) => state.increasePopulation)
  return <button onClick={increasePopulation}>one up</button>
}
```
